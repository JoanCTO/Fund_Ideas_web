## 🏆 Hackathon Submission

### Title

**Fund Ideas - Technical Product Crowdfunding Platform**

### Description

Fund Ideas is a specialized milestone-based crowdfunding platform that bridges the gap between Product Hunt and traditional crowdfunding. Built exclusively for technical digital products (apps, software, SaaS, dev tools, courses), it enables creators to bootstrap their companies without equity dilution while giving backers early access to innovative products at significant discounts.

The platform features a unique milestone-based funding model where backers only pay when deliverables are completed and approved by the community, ensuring accountability and reducing risk for both parties. With creator verification, portfolio review, and community-driven project evaluation, Fund Ideas creates a trusted ecosystem for technical innovation.

### Inspiration

The inspiration came from recognizing a critical gap in the crowdfunding ecosystem: technical creators building digital products needed a specialized platform that understood their unique challenges. Traditional crowdfunding platforms weren't designed for software development cycles, technical validation, or the milestone-based approach that digital products require.

We were inspired by:

- **Product Hunt's** community-driven discovery model
- **Traditional crowdfunding's** ability to validate ideas and raise capital
- **The need for technical creators** to access funding without equity dilution
- **The opportunity** to create early access opportunities for backers at discounted prices
